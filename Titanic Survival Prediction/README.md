# Titanic Survival Prediction
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;A machine learning model is built on titatic dataset that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not.<br>
<br>
## <b>1.Define the problem: </b><br>
&emsp;&emsp;i.We identified that the model need to perform classification task<br>
## <b>2.Data Aquasition and preperation: </b><br>
&emsp;&emsp;i.Load the TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION dataset into a DataFrame.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;ii.Explore the dataset to understand its structure, feature columns, and target variable.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;iii.Handle missing values, if any, through imputation or removal.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;iv.Perform any necessary data transformations, such as scaling or encoding categorical variables.<br>
## <b>3.Data Visualization and Analysis: </b><br>
&emsp;&emsp;i.Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the relationships between features and the target variable.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;ii.Visualize the data using plots, histograms, scatter plots, etc., to identify patterns, correlations, and outliers.<br>
## <b>4.Data Preprocessing: </b><br>
&emsp;&emsp;i.Drop and fill missing values.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;ii.Data Transformation.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;iii.Feature engineering<br>
&emsp;&emsp;iv.Feature encoding<br>
## <b>5.Split the data into training and testing datasets</b><br>
&emsp;&emsp;i.Split the data into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the model, and the testing set evaluates its performance on unseen data.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;ii.Split the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split() from scikit-learn.<br>
## 6.Model Selection and Training<br>
&emsp;&emsp;i.A suitable machine learning model for classification task is choosen.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;ii.Creating a machine learning model : Logistic Regression<br>
&emsp;&emsp;iii.Train the model on the training set. This involves feeding the data to the chosen algorithm and optimizing its parameters to improve its ability to learn from the data.<br>
## 7.Model Deployment and Monitoring<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it in a production environment for real-time predictions.
